    "## Introduction\n",
    "Given a set of genomes, the pan genome is the collection of all genes the set contains. Roary, the pan genome pipeline, takes closely related annotated genomes in GFF3 format and calculates the pan genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depht information about Roary, please feel free to have a look the paper:\n",

    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand what a pangenome is\n",
    "* Prepare data for input to Roary\n",
    "* Perform QC on input data and understand why QC is important\n",
    "* Run Roary to create a pangenome with and without a core alignment and understand the different output files produced by Roary\n",
    "* Draw a basic tree from the core gene alignment produced by Roary\n",
    "* Query the pangenome results produced by Roary\n",
    "* Use Phandango to visualise the results produced by Roary \n",

    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "This tutorial comprises the following stages:\n",
    "1. [What is a pan genome](pan_genome.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Preparing input data](prepare_data.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Performing QC on your data](qc.ipynb)\n",
    "4. [Running Roary](run_roary.ipynb)\n",
    "5. [Exploring the results](results.ipynb)\n",
    "6. [Visualising the results with phandango](phandango.ipynb)\n",

    "## Authors\n",
    "This tutorial was created by [Sara Sjunnebo](https://github.com/ssjunnebo).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the commands from this tutorial\n",
    "You can run the commands in this tutorial either directly from the Jupyter notebook (if using Jupyter), or by typing the commands in your terminal window. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running commands on Jupyter\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter, command cells (like the one below) can be run by selecting the cell and clicking _Cell -> Run_ from the menu above or using _ctrl Enter_ to run the command. Let's give this a try by printing our working directory using the _pwd_ command and listing the files within it. Run the commands in the two cells below."
