    "# Visualising the results with phandango\n",
    "[Phandango](http://phandango.net/) is a web based tool for visualising genomic analysis results such as phylogenetic trees and the output of Roary and other tools. Using phandango is really easy, you just drag your files onto the browser and drop them and it will display them for you automatically. For more in depth information please feel free to have a look around the [phandango wiki page](https://github.com/jameshadfield/phandango/wiki). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section of the tutorial we are going to use phandango to look at the pylogenetic tree we generated using FastTree, and the gene_presence_absence.csv file we got from Roary. Simly dragging the two files and droping them on the phandango front page will give you the following view:\n",
