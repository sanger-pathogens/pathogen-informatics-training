    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "DEAGO generates user-friendly quality control (QC) and analysis reports for RNA-Seq datasets. These interactive reports can be opened simply in a web browser and provide a simple way of sharing information about your analysis with collaborators. \n",
    "\n",
    "DEAGO uses a Perl wrapper module (**[Bio-Deago](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Bio-Deago)**) to generate a HTML report from markdown templates by calling functions from an R package (**[deago](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/deago)**). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main steps to each analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generating QC plots (**[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)**)\n",
    "* Identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes (**[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)**) \n",
    "* Performing gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analyses (**[topGO](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/topGO.html)**)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "There is a short [DEAGO tutorial](DEAGO-tutorial.ipynb) which will give you an opportunity to look at example input data, run some DEAGO analyses and look at the output files which are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DEAGO user guide is split into several sections: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Input files](Input-files.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Output files](Output-files.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Preparing an annotation file](Preparing-an-annotation-file.ipynb)\n",
    "4. [Quality control (QC)](Quality-control.ipynb)\n",
    "5. [Identifying DE genes](Identifying-DE-genes.ipynb)\n",
    "6. [GO term enrichment](GO-term-enrichment.ipynb)\n",
    "7. [Bespoke analyses](Bespoke-analyses.ipynb)\n",

    "## Authors\n",
    "This tutorial was created by [Victoria Offord](https://github.com/vaofford).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the commands from this tutorial\n",
    "You can run the commands in this tutorial either directly from the Jupyter notebook (if using Jupyter), or by typing the commands in your terminal window. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running commands on Jupyter\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter, command cells (like the one below) can be run by selecting the cell and clicking _Cell -> Run_ from the menu above or using _ctrl Enter_ to run the command. Let's give this a try by printing our working directory using the _pwd_ command and listing the files within it. Run the commands in the two cells below."
