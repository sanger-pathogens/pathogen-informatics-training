    "# Visualising alignments in IGV\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often instructive to look at your data in a genome browser. Here, we use [IGV](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv), a stand-alone browser, which has the advantage of being installed locally and providing fast access. Please check their website ([http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv)) for all the formats that IGV can display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web-based genome browsers, like [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org) or the [UCSC browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway), are slower, but provide more functionality. They do not only allow for more polished and flexible visualisation, but also provide easy access to a wealth of annotations and external data sources. This makes it straightforward to relate your data with information about  repeat regions, known genes, epigenetic features or areas of cross-species conservation, to name just a few. As such, they are useful tools for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation will allow you to get a \"feel\" for the data, as well as detecting abnormalities and problems. Also, exploring the data in such a way may give you ideas for further analyses. For our visualization purposes we will use the BAM and bigWig formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "When uploading a BAM file into the genome browser, the browser will look for the **index** of the BAM file in the same folder where the BAM files is. The index file should have the same name as the BAM file and the suffix `.bai`. Finally, to create the index of a BAM file you need to make sure that the file is **sorted** according to chromosomal\n",
