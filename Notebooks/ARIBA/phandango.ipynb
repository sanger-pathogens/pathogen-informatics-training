    "ARIBA has a functon called \"[summary](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-summary)\" that can summarise presence/absence of sequences and/or SNPs across samples. It takes at least two ariba reports as input, and makes a CSV file that can be opened in your favourite spreadsheet program, and also makes input files for Phandango. The two Phandango files (a tree and a CSV file) can be dropped straight into the Phandango page for viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree that ARIBA makes is based on the CSV file, which contains results of presence/absence of sequence and SNPs, and other information such as percent identity bewteen contigs and reference sequences. This means that it does not necessarily represent the real phylogeny of the samples. It is more accurate to provide a tree built from the sequencing data. For this reason, we will use a pre-computed tree file `data/tree_for_phandango.tre`.\n",

Further, the names must exactly match the names in the tree file for Phandango to work (have a look in the tree file `data/tree_for_phandango.tre`). You could do a little hacking here using the Unix command `sed` on the CSV file. Instead, we can supply ARIBA with a file of filenames that also tells ariba what to call the samples in its output CSV files. Instead of \"data/ARIBA_reports/ERR1067709.tsv\", we would like to simply use \"ERR1067709\", which is cleaner and matches the tree file. It also means we can (and will) repeatedly run `ariba summary` with different options, and get output files that can be loaded straight into Phandango.
