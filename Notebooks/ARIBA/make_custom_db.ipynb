    "# Make custom ARIBA database\n",
    "\n",
    "For the *N. gonorrhoeae* data of the manuscript, we were interested in particular sequences and SNPs. This means using custom reference data as opposed to one of the public reference sets (the use of which is described [in the ARIBA wiki page](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-getref)). If you just want to use a public database, then use the command \"[ariba getref](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-getref)\" instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in several reference sequences, some of which are coding seqeunces and others are not, and particular variants in those sequences. The idea is to generate input files to ARIBA that contain all the sequences and variants of interest, using the ARIBA function [aln2meta](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-aln2meta).\n",

    "There are several alleles of *folP* and we want to include them all the ARIBA database. We have a SNP of interest R228S in the sequence in the allele called \"folP.WHO_F_01537c\", which confers resistance to sulphonamides. When we run ARIBA, a particular sample may have a different allele from folP.WHO_F_01537c, but we would still like to know whether it has the SNP R228S. However, the position may not be 228 because of insertion or deletions. So we use a multiple alignment of all the reference alleles, and just supply the SNP to ARIBA in one of the alleles, in this case folP.WHO_F_01537c.\n",
